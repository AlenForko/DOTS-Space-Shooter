# DOTS Space Shooter

## About
This is a DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) Space Shooter game created in Unity. It is not a fully playable game, as it is only to show the power of DOTS.
In the final version, asteroids will spawn around the player and move towards the player. At some point, the screen will be filled with asteroids and start
destroying themselves when they collide with the player.
